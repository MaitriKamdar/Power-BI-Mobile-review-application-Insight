# Power-BI-Mobile-review-application-Insight

ðŸš€ New Power BI Project Completed!

I recently created an interactive Power BI dashboard to analyze mobile app reviews. ðŸ“±âœ¨

The dashboard provides insights into:
ðŸ”¹ App Ratings & Trends â€“ Compare performance across devices, app versions, and categories.
ðŸ”¹ User Demographics â€“ Explore age, gender, and country distributions of reviewers.
ðŸ”¹ Review Helpfulness â€“ Identify which reviews are most valuable to users.
ðŸ”¹ Sentiment & Language Insights â€“ Word cloud and language breakdown to understand global feedback.

This project helped me practice:
âœ… Data cleaning & transformation
âœ… Building DAX measures for KPIs
âœ… Designing meaningful visualizations for decision-making

Power BI is such a powerful tool to turn raw data into actionable insights, and this dashboard is just one example of its potential.

ðŸ’¡ Excited to continue exploring real-world analytics projects!
